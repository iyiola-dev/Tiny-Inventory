Goal
Build a small full-stack app where you make the key design decisions. We care more about your
choices and reasoning than about specific frameworks or patterns.
The Problem
Tiny Inventory — Build a small inventory management system that tracks stores and the
products they carry. Each store can have multiple products, and each product includes basic
details such as name, category, price, and quantity in stock. The system should allow managing
stores and products, viewing products per store or across all stores, and filtering or paginating
product lists (for example, by category, price range, or stock level).
Minimal Requirements
Backend
● TypeScript HTTP server exposing a REST API with at least two related resources (e.g.,
Store ↔ Product).
● Include at least one non-trivial operation (something beyond CRUD — e.g., aggregation
or computed data).
● Include filtering and pagination on one list endpoint.
● Any persistence is acceptable (in-memory, file, SQLite, Postgres, etc.).
Frontend
● React (TypeScript) app with at least two screens (list view + detail/edit view).
● Handle loading and error states gracefully.
● Provide seed data so reviewers can interact immediately.
● Include basic input validation and clear error responses.
Infrastructure
● Dockerize everything so it runs with a single command (e.g., docker compose up
--build).
What We’ll Look For
● Clarity of choices and explanations.
● Address all aspects of making this application production-ready.
● API semantics (routes, validation, pagination, error design).
● Data modeling and querying.
● UX basics (list/detail flow, loading/error/empty states).
● Dev experience (simple Docker startup, clear project structure).
• Testing quality and rationale
• README clarity (decisions and trade-offs explained)

○ Testing Approach section.
○ If I had more time (3 bullets).
Appendix / FAQ
What is a non-trivial operation?
A non-trivial operation goes beyond basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functions. It
involves computations like summaries, aggregations, or metrics (e.g., "total inventory value by
store" or "issues closed per day").
What does "provide seed data" mean?
Providing seed data means your application starts with pre-populated example data, allowing
reviewers to immediately interact with the system. This can be implemented via a startup script,
an in-memory dataset, or a specific seed command.
Do I have to use Postgres?
No, you are free to choose any persistence option. Please explain your choice in the
README.md 
file.
How much should I focus on the frontend versus the backend?
Strive for a balanced approach between frontend and backend development. However, it's
acceptable to lean towards one, provided you explain your focus and reasoning in the
README.md
.
What kind of filtering and pagination do you expect?
You should implement at least one list endpoint that includes both filtering and pagination
capabilities. The specific implementation style is at your discretion.

Do I need authentication?
No, authentication is not required. It's optional if you wish to demonstrate it. If you do implement
it, keep it simple (e.g., using a hardcoded user or token).
How polished should the submission be?
Your submission should run cleanly, feature readable code, and demonstrate basic validation
and error handling.
What if I run out of time?
That’s fine. Just note what’s missing, what you’d do next, and any assumptions in your
README.
